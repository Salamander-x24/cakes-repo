Ingredients
3 medium tart apples, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices (3 cups)
3 tablespoons plus 1 cup sugar, divided
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2/3 cup butter, softened
4 large eggs, room temperature
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/8 teaspoon salt
Directions
In a large bowl, combine the apples, 3 tablespoons sugar and cinnamon; let stand for 1 hour.
In another bowl, cream butter and remaining sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla. Combine flour and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and beat until smooth.
Transfer to a greased 9x5-in. loaf pan. Push apple slices vertically into batter, placing them close together.
Bake at 300Â° for 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack. Serve warm.

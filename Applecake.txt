Ingredients
1/2 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
2 large eggs, room temperature
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract
1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
glaze:
2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 tablespoons lemon juice
Directions
In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the sour cream and extracts. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda; add to creamed mixture just until moistened.
Fill 12 greased or paper-lined muffin cups three-fourths full. Bake at 400Â° until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 18-20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack.
Combine the glaze ingredients; drizzle over muffins. Serve warm.

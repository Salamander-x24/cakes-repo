Ingredients
2 cups white sugar

1 cup butter, softened

2 eggs

1 cup sour cream

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 ⅝ cups all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

¼ teaspoon salt

1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries

½ cup brown sugar

½ cup chopped pecans

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch Bundt pan.

Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in sour cream and vanilla extract.

Combine flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into butter mixture until just blended. Fold in blueberries; spoon 1/2 of the batter into the prepared pan.

Combine brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle 1/2 of the mixture over batter in the pan. Spoon remaining batter on top, then sprinkle over remaining pecan mixture. Use a knife or thin spatula to swirl the sugar layer into the cake.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool briefly on a wire rack. Invert carefully onto a serving plate; dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.

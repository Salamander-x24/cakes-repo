cooking=
Preheat oven to 350Â°. In a large bowl, beat sugar, eggs and oil until lemon-colored and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in orange zest and vanilla.
In another bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt; fold into egg mixture. Stir in poppy seeds. Transfer to a greased 13x9-in. baking pan, spreading evenly. Arrange plum slices over batter (do not press into batter).
Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 40-45 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and additional cinnamon before serving.

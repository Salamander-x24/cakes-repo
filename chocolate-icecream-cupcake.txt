20g crème-filled chocolate sandwich cookies, plus 8 whole cookies for decorating
60g unsalted butter, melted
300ml double cream
200g condensed milk
For the topping
100ml double cream
1 tbsp icing sugar

Method
STEP 1
Line eight holes of a 12-hole cupcake tin with paper cases. Tip the cookies into a food processor and blitz to a fine crumb, or do this in a bowl using the end of a rolling pin. Measure 215g of the crumbs into a bowl and mix in the melted butter. Divide the mixture between the paper cases, pressing it into the bases slightly.

STEP 2
Pour the cream, condensed milk and 55g of the remaining crushed cookies into a bowl, and whisk until just starting to thicken, about 5 mins. Spoon the mixture evenly over the chocolate cookie bases, then freeze for at least 2 hrs or overnight until solid. Will keep frozen for up to two days.

STEP 3
Just before serving, make the topping. Whip the cream with the icing sugar using an electric whisk until it’s a pipeable consistency. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe a swirl of whipped cream over each cupcake. Decorate each with a whole cookie and remaining cookie crumbs. Serve immediately.
